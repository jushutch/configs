# vimrc
My personal .vimrc for Vim configuration and a patched version of the JetBrains Mono font 
for powerline symbols. 

### Using
Move .vimrc to the home directory (~), or the approriate place depending on where you want to use it.


Use Vundle to install the Vim plugins; to install Vundle, run:  
`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`  
For more detailed instructions and documentation, view the [Vundle GitHub repo](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).


To install all of the plugins required by .vimrc, run:  
`vim +PluginInstall +qall`


Install the JetBrains Mono font according to your OS and set it as your terminal's default font.


### Support
The JetBrains Nerd Font is from [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). This
.vimrc was inspired by [wolf/dotfiles](https://github.com/wolf/dotfiles) (you're great Wolf, thanks for
all of the Vim help!)
